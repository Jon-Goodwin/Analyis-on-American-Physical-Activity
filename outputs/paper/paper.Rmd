abstract: "Recreational activity and physical fitness are important factors in determining the health and safety of a society. We obtain data regarding the activity of individuals of different states and age groups as well as their respective distance to a park. We find that citizens who live closer to parks are more likely to be physically active, and that younger citizens are more likely to be physically active then older ones. These findings have implications for the future development of public recreational structures."

# Introduction {#Intro}

 Physical activity is an important indicator for the health of the population of the United States. As well living near to a public recreational service like a park allows residents a more convenient place to excercise. We see that decreasing the distance to a park as well as giving more opportunity for residents to participate in activities like biking is associated with more physically active residents who meet the CDC's guidelines for strength and aerobic health.

  We analyzed the sources of water for two subsets of the Jordan population, urban and rural residents. From Figure ###Reference### and Figure ###Reference###, we can see that both California is the state with the most active populace, and that New York is the state where residents most commonly walk and/or bike to work. We also see that more rural states like Nebraska and Alaska have the fewest people living near a park.

  This information is relevant to the further development and enhancement of the recreational and physical activity of citizens of the United States as well as leader of respective states when developing cities. The data can help to identify populaces with particularly low activity reletive to the rest of the country as well as identify states that are lacking in public recreational support for its citizens.

  In section \@ref(Data) we talk about the process of gathering and analyzing the dataset and the variables. Then in section \@ref(Results) we discuss the implications of the dataset presented. Finally in section \@ref(Discussion) we discuss implications for the United States citizens, as well as the weakness of the study and the further investigation that may be useful to the topic of recreational activity support and physical activity in the United States.

# Data {#Data}

  The dataset is from the National Health Interview Survey. The survey was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [@citeCDC] and the data used was from the years 2010 to 2020.The survey was conducted and funded by the CDC but also has numerous sponsors found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/supplements_cosponsors.htm).

  The survey has been conducted every year for over 50 years, the sample is nationally representative, the intent of the survey is to monitor the health of the nation, as it collects information by interviewing American households. The content of the survey is updated roughly every 15-20 years with the most recent being in 2019. Of which 30,000 adults and 9,000 children were interviewed. Of this survey, this analysis focused on the information regarding the proportion of adults classified as obese or overweight, and how they responded to questions regarding aerobic activity and weight training. The data is collected from all 50 states including the District of Columbia and Peurto Rico, there is also a section included for the National averages of each question response.
  
  To compile the data set, the R language was used[@citeR], along with the packages, Pointblank [@citepointblank], haven [@citehaven], the paper was compiled using Knitr [@citeknitr] and KableExtra[@citeakableExtra] packages. Also made use of reshape2 [@citereshape2] in manipulating the data to create plots.
  
  Table \@ref(tab:tab1) gives a small look at the dataset.

```{r tab1, echo = FALSE, fig.pos = 'H'}
### Buidling Table Excerpt ###
df = Data[,-1]
names(df)[names(df) == 'YearEnd'] <- 'Year'
names(df)[names(df) == 'LocationDesc'] <- 'State'
names(df)[names(df) == 'Data_Value'] <- 'Percent'
names(df)[names(df) == 'Age.years.'] <- 'Age'
knitr::kable(head(df),booktabs = TRUE, align = "c", caption = "Excerpt of dataset") %>% 
kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

  In total there are 6 characteristics from the survey being analyzed, they are:
  
1. "Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who have obesity"                                                                                                                                           
2. "Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who have an overweight classification"                                                                                                                      
3. "Percent of adults who engage in no leisure-time physical activity"                                                                                                                                    
4. "Percent of adults who achieve at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (or an equivalent combination)" 

5. "Percent of adults who engage in muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week"                                                                                                             
6. "Percent of adults who achieve at least 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (or an equivalent combination)"

These are stratified into 6 different age groups for adults, those 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65 and older.

The responses are given as a proportion of the sample, rounded to 1 digit. So the value 35.2 means, 35.2% of respondents in that age group had been affirmative to that trait in the survey.

# Model {#Model}

```{r model, echo = FALSE, fig.pos = 'H'}

```

# Results {#Results}

  From Figure \@ref(fig:fig1) we see a chart comparing the proportion of respondents who were obese based on the different states in the country. We can see from the chart that all states lie between a rate of 20% and 35% obese.

```{r fig1, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Bar plot of Obesity by State", fig.width=8,fig.height=8}
### Bar plot of Obesity by State ###
df1 <- subset(df, Year == 2011)
df2 <- subset(df, Year == 2020)
df1 <- subset(df1, Question == "Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who have obesity")
df1 <- df1[order(df1$State),]
x <- c()
i = 1
while (i < 312) {
  y = mean(c(df1[i,4],df1[i+1,4],df1[i+2,4],df1[i+3,4],df1[i+4,4],df1[i+5,4]))
  x <- c(x,y)
  i = i+6
}
df_means <- cbind(unique(df1$Year),unique(df1$State), unique(df1$Question), round(x, digits = 1))
df_means <- as.data.frame(df_means)
df_long <- melt(df_means[order(df_means$V4),])
p <- ggplot(df_long, aes(x = V2, y = as.numeric(V4), fill = V4)) +scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,35)) + theme(legend.position="none", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5, hjust=0)) + geom_bar(width = 0.8, stat = "identity", position = 'dodge') +
  xlab("State") +
  ylab("Percent of Population")

p + coord_flip()
```

Below Table \@ref(tab:tab2), shows the states with the lowest proportions of obesity.

```{r tab2, echo = FALSE, fig.pos = 'H'}
### Buidling Excerpt ###
df.means2 <- df_means[order(df_means$V4),]
names(df.means2)[names(df.means2) == 'V2'] <- 'State'
names(df.means2)[names(df.means2) == 'V4'] <- 'Proportion'
df.new <- cbind(df.means2$State,df.means2$Proportion)
knitr::kable(head(df.new),booktabs = TRUE, align = "c", caption = "Excerpt of dataset") %>% 
kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```


And here Table \@ref(tab:tab3) gives the 6 states with the highest obesity rates.


```{r tab3, echo = FALSE, fig.pos = 'H'}
### Buidling Excerpt ###
df.means3 <- df_means[order(df_means$V4, decreasing = T),]
names(df.means3)[names(df.means3) == 'V2'] <- 'State'
names(df.means3)[names(df.means3) == 'V4'] <- 'Proportion'
df.new2 <- cbind(df.means2$State,df.means2$Proportion)
knitr::kable(tail(df.new2),booktabs = TRUE, align = "c", caption = "Excerpt of dataset") %>%
